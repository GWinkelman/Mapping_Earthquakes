# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
This project involved learning how to use JS and APIs in order to map earthquake data from various JSON files.  Using Mapbox, I was able to create interactive maps that show all earthquakes in the previous 7 days, major earthquakes in the previous 7 days, and the tectonic plates.  All of these maps are able to be opened over the same map, and there are 3 different maps to choose from regarding color/details.  

I ran into a CORS error for a while with the tectonic plate dataset, but I was able to install an extension in my browser that fixed the issue.  The different layers of the map can be seen working in the image section below.

## Images of working, interactive map:

Map layer that shows all earthquakes in the last 7 days:

Map layer that shows all major earthquakes in the last 7 days:

Map later that shows the tectonic plates:
